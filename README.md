>This paper use a special kernel, set kernel, to deal with multi-instance learning from a bag level. The model is named PU-SKC, which can be seen as a SVM based model. The method can be also extended to instance-level classification.

>The conventional Seq2Seq model have high precision at the beginning of the decoding but it decreases as the time step prolonged. To solve this problem, this paper propose a novel bidirectional decoding for Seq2Seq. 

> Concern: while the performance of the first time-steps and last time-steps increase, the accuracy in the middle might be still low.
> Moreover, Info leak?
